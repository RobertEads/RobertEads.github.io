		<p style="margin-top:2%">My name is Robert Eads and I am 20 years old. I was born and raised in the Dallas, Texas area and I whole hearted embrace Texas culture. My hobbies include running, playing basketball, 
			and listening to music.</p>
		<p>My love of technology started the moment I got my first laptop in 6th grade and has not stopped growing. 
			I built my first computer during sophmore year of high school and have been tinkering with any technology I can get my hands on ever since.
			My first experience with programming was the summer after 7th grade at a University of Texas at Dallas coding camp. That exploration got me hooked on programming and afterwards I took just about every computer science
			class my high school had to offer. Now, I am a student at Texas A&M University studying for my B.S. in computer science.</p>
