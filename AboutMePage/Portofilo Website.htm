		<p>My name is Robert Eads and I am 20 years old. I was born and raised in the Dallas, Texas area and I whole hearted embrace Texas culture.
		My love of technology started the moment I got my first laptop in 6th grade and has not stopped growing. 
		I built my first computer during my sophmore year of high school and have been tinkering with any technology I can get my hands on ever since.</p>
		<p>My first experience with coding was the summer after 7th grade at a University of Texas at Dallas coding camp. That exploration got me hooked on coding and after that I took just about every computer science
		class my school offered when I got to high school. I am now a student at Texas A&M University studying for my undergraduate degree in computer science.</p>
		<p>Langauages I have worked in before include:
		 <ul>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>Java</li>
			<li>C++</li> 
			<li>HMTL/CSS</li>
		 </ul></p>
